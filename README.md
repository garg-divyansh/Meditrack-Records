MOTIVATION

In recent years there have been lot of instances when people have faced difficulties in terms of the service provided to them by the hospitals in which their loved ones are being treated and taken care of. Whether it is standing in the long queue for the medicines or waiting to know the status of their diagnosis. There often has been some communication gap between the doctors, the hospital management and the patient’s family, leading to difficult situations for everyone involved, and sometimes even causing a feeling of despair and panic among the family members.

With our program we aim to solve this rising issue and avoid such circumstances to arise in the near future and make the journey in hospitals much smoother for families in their tough times.
